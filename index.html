<h1>KENALI JOHOR DARUL TAKZIM</h1>
</center>
<br>
<center><p>They say that stranger's soul is incomprehensible,
 but we can't entirely agree with the statement.<br>
Most often we just don't want to notice the obvious,
 pretending that it's too personal <br>
 matter or something of the kind.
In fact, a human soul is not as dark as it seems.<br>
 It is always 
ready and even willing to reveal its secrets to the confidant.
 As a rule,web<br>
 community members having their own websites are 
 open for communication, socialization and other<br>
 things like 
 that. Besides, personal websites serve as a kind of virtual CVs for
 their owners.
<br> Most often, if you are as sharp as a needle, seeing
 a person's website,you'll easily tell <br>
 even more about site
 owner than he/she wanted to say.
